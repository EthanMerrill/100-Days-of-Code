## Projects:

### Responsive Web Design:
<a href="https://ethanmerrill.github.io/100-Days-of-Code/Responsive_Web_Design_Projects/Build_A_Personal_Portfolio_Webpage/PersonalPortfolioPage.html">**Personal Portfolio**</a> A portfolio linking to the other projects from the responsive web design module. I used d3 to dynamically create a force directed chart of my projects and experiences from a json file. 

<a href="https://ethanmerrill.github.io/100-Days-of-Code/Responsive_Web_Design_Projects/Build_a_Product_Landing_Page/Landing_Page.html">**Product Landing Page**</a>
A parody landing page based on a College Humor skit for an online bowl Store. It is a riff on "Blands" and the idea that everything can be a chic startup selling basic goods directly to consumers.

<a href="https://ethanmerrill.github.io/100-Days-of-Code/Responsive_Web_Design_Projects/Build_A_Survey_Form/SurveyForm.html">**Survey Form**</a> Survey Form for Pet owners. The Background Gradient is an interesting feature to this project.

<a href="https://ethanmerrill.github.io/100-Days-of-Code/Responsive_Web_Design_Projects/Build_a_Technical_Documentation_page/index.html">**Technical Documentation Page**</a> This page may not be the prettiest, but I am proud of how fast it was put together. I got most of the content from my existing notes, which are in markdown. I exported the markdown to an HTML file, made some tweaks to pass the FCC tests and its finished!

<a href="https://ethanmerrill.github.io/100-Days-of-Code/Responsive_Web_Design_Projects/Build_a_Tribute_Page/TributePage.html">**Tribute Page**</a> A tribute page to Percival Baxter. This was my first time using Flexbox-grid.

# Data Structures and Algorithms

<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ethanmerrill/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures">Data Structures Certification</a> I successfully completed all 294 coding challenges and 5 projects to earn this certification. 

# Front-End Frameworks:

<a href="https://ethanmerrill.github.io/100-Days-of-Code/Frontend_Frameworks_Projects/Random_Quote_Machine/random_quote_machine/dist/index.html">All Frontend Challenges</a> A page which has all 5 frontend challenges with passing tests. I used React Router, Functional Components, and hooks to create the projects.
