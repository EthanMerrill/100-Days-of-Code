## Projects:

### Responsive Web Design:
<a href="https://ethanmerrill.github.io/100-Days-of-Code/Responsive_Web_Design_Projects/Build_A_Personal_Portfolio_Webpage/PersonalPortfolioPage.html">**Personal Portfolio**</a> A portfolio linking to the other projects from the responsive web design module. <a href="https://www.repostatus.org/#wip"><img src="https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg" alt="Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public." /></a>

<a href="https://ethanmerrill.github.io/100-Days-of-Code/Responsive_Web_Design_Projects/Build_a_product_Landing_Page/Landing_Page.html">**Product Landing Page**</a>
This is a Parody Landing Page based on a college Humor Skit for an online Bowl Store. It is a riff on "Blands" and the idea that everything can be a chic startup selling basic goods directly to consumers. 

<a href="https://ethanmerrill.github.io/100-Days-of-Code/Responsive_Web_Design_Projects/Build_A_Survey_Form/SurveyForm.html">**Survey Form**</a> Survey Form for Pet owners. The Background Gradient is an interesting feature to this project

<a href="https://ethanmerrill.github.io/100-Days-of-Code/Responsive_Web_Design_Projects/Build_a_Technical_Documentation_page/index.html">**Technical Documentation Page**</a> This page may not be the prettiest, but I am proud of how fast it was put together. I got most of the content from my existing notes, which are in markdown. I exported the markdown to an HTML file, made some tweaks to pass the FCC tests and its finished!
