# 100 Days of code

## Day 1

WHY: Why code every day for 100 days? So many reasons! First of all I know some web stuff, some python and I even learned Java 4ish years ago. However I don't feel competent in any of this, certainly not experienced enough to freelance, which is the ultimate goal. Additionally I am going to use this challenge to give myself some purpose! I have 3 months without other commitments which is awesome, but I need to impose some discipline to use this time wisely and accomplish anything. Ideally I will end this experience feeling empowered and with real progress and projects to show off. Finally, I decided I need to share more. I am a 'lurker' or someone who just consumes on the web, I want to be a *Maker*! 

So with that out of the way, I have some things to learn :)

*What I did today*
- Basic Html and HTML5 section (1:41) 
*Questions*
- Does the label always have to have a for attribute to link it to its nested elements?
- what is value for again?

## Day 2

Day 1 was pretty easy, The Basic HTML and CSS Section had only 28 modules that I breezed through. Today's CSS section has 48 modules, so I anticipate it will take slightly longer. Yesterday I learned some new things about forms such as how to make checkboxes and radio boxes ticked by default. I also learned how to make fields required. 

*What I did Today*
- Basic CSS (1:18)
- Started applied Visual Design (26:25)


# Day 3 

Still a little fuzzy on the before and after pseudo elements...Applied visual design was 



# Day 6

Finished the lessons for the responsive web design certification. Today I spent time on grid. I am still a little confused, but I will try to use it in the upcoming projects. I'm surprised that I sped through the lessons so fast, perhaps I will pay for this later. I have prior experience, but I am glad I refreshed my memory. Also I definitely learned a lot of new things as a result of going through the lessons. Today I started my first challenge for the responsive web design cert. I am making a tribute page on Percival Baxter. I made a site that passed all the tests in 30 mins, but I really want to work on my design skills, so I think I'll spend half of tomorrow improving the design of the page. Right now the page is...sparse to say the least. 

*What I did Today* 
- Finished Grid Lesson
- Started Tribute page challenge

# Day 7


# Day 9 
Took notes on Design video stream on the FreeCodeCamp Youtube channel. I did this because I am really no happy with how my sites turn out.
