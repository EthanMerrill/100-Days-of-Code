# 100 Days of code

## Day 1

WHY: Why code every day for 100 days? So many reasons! First of all I know some web stuff, some python and I even learned Java 4ish years ago. However I don't feel competent in any of this, certainly not experienced enough to freelance, which is the ultimate goal. Additionally I am going to use this challenge to give myself some purpose! I have 3 months without other commitments which is awesome, but I need to impose some discipline to use this time wisely and accomplish anything. Ideally I will end this experience feeling empowered and with real progress and projects to show off. Finally, I decided I need to share more. I am a 'lurker' or someone who just consumes on the web, I want to be a *Maker*! 

So with that out of the way, I have some things to learn :)

*What I did today*
- Basic Html and HTML5 section (1:41) 
*Questions*
- Does the label always have to have a for attribute to link it to its nested elements?
- what is value for again?

## Day 2

Day 1 was pretty easy, The Basic HTML and CSS Section had only 28 modules that I breezed through. Today's CSS section has 48 modules, so I anticipate it will take slightly longer. Yesterday I learned some new things about forms such as how to make checkboxes and radio boxes ticked by default. I also learned how to make fields required. 

*What I did Today*
- Basic CSS (1:18)
- Started applied Visual Design (26:25)


# Day 3 

Still a little fuzzy on the before and after pseudo elements...Applied visual design was 



# Day 6

Finished the lessons for the responsive web design certification. Today I spent time on grid. I am still a little confused, but I will try to use it in the upcoming projects. I'm surprised that I sped through the lessons so fast, perhaps I will pay for this later. I have prior experience, but I am glad I refreshed my memory. Also I definitely learned a lot of new things as a result of going through the lessons. Today I started my first challenge for the responsive web design cert. I am making a tribute page on Percival Baxter. I made a site that passed all the tests in 30 mins, but I really want to work on my design skills, so I think I'll spend half of tomorrow improving the design of the page. Right now the page is...sparse to say the least. 

*What I did Today* 
- Finished Grid Lesson
- Started Tribute page challenge

# Day 7


# Day 9 
Took notes on Design video stream on the FreeCodeCamp YouTube channel. I did this because I am really no happy with how my sites turn out. 

# Day 10 
Finished the Survey page

# Day 11
Started the Landing page challenge

# Day 12
Started a project to scrape data from glassdoor.com. I got the basics down in 6 hours. So far The program scrapes the reviews on the page and prints them in the terminal. The goal is to get all of the data into a pandas dataframe then visualize it with plotly or possibly d3. 

# Day 13
Worked on the parser for the Glassdoor Scraper. I asked by first question on Stack overflow! I don't think anyone has answered yet, but I figured it out, so I may answer it myself tomorrow. 

# Day 14
Finally got the scraper to work (mostly) I decided I am going to do the visualization in PowerBI because this project is taking longer than expected. I can do the d3 later. Things left to do are: Make the date formatting compatible with PowerBI which will involve working with `strptime` in python, and making the sub rankings scraper work. Hopefully I can finish those up tomorrow and get back to FCC. I need to finish the React certification by the end of this!

# Day 15
The Scraper is Good Enough! I tooled around in PowerBI to get a few pretty charts. I think I would need an additional two days to make the data cleaner and PowerBI laid out in a usable manner, however I want to keep up a good pace on the FCC Challenges. I also just found the visual on Free Code Camp that shows your current streak. I pushed anything to the site in over a week! (looking at my time records, I last worked on a Free Code Camp challenge 4 days ago) Maybe I can get a quick and dirty product page working tonight.

# Day 16 
Half day today. I want to get the skeleton of the Product page finished by eod. 
- read up on font pairings
- added a local font 

## Skip Day

# Day 17 
Tweaked styling of the page. 

# Day 18 

- Got the Navbar styled
- photo crop and rotation

# Day 19
This product page needs to be done. As of this Morning it passes all but the navbar tests, but I still want to make links change color in the navbar, improve the Card styling, and adjust the Features section. Also the navbar behaves as described in the User Story, but still doesn't pass the test, I'll have to look into that. I am having some trouble with the link hover transition in the navbar at the moment. 

The navbar was just 10 pixels too low! The test exceptions are written very well. 

- [X] Make navbar test pass
- [ ] Make navbar hover transition work
- [ ] Clean up the Survey

# Day 20
Cleaned up the card on the bottom of the page. I am about halfway through the basic JavaScript exercises. I am quite happy with how the fake product site works. I might tweet it to College Humor and see if they reply. I just have to make the survey and make the navbar work how I want it to.  

# Day 21 

- [X] Make navbar hover transition work
- [ ] Clean up the Survey

# Day 22 

- [ ] Make dropdown work/clean up the survey

To make this work I needed find elements on the page, then add event listeners. For this to work properly the script had to be executed after the page loaded. According to stack overflow, the proper way to do this is: ```window.onload=function```, so that is how I implemented it.

This site is *not* going to be mobile optimized, because I already spent a week on it. I can't even make the media query(which does exist) work properly, or at all. 

# Day 23 

I started playing around with another project in d3, which I probably will never finish. I didn't even make a Github Repo for it. It is a visualization for the availability of electric vehicles. 

# Day 24 

FINISH IT! Almost a quarter of the way through and I'm not even finished with basic web! C'mon! Today I NEED to finish the promo website. Its been passing the tests all week I just need to clean up the survey and add a quick footer--Nothing else! No Mission Creep!

- [x] Clean up Survey Expansion Box
- [x] add a quick n dirty footer
- [x] MAYBE Add more filler text as a result of the Bloomberg Blands article
- [x] Submit Product Landing Page
{done in 1st Hour, its amazing what focus can do!}

- [x] Finish & Submit Documentation Challenge

future:
- [ ] Start Portfolio Challenge
- [ ] Do more JavaScript Exercises
- [ ] Work on Electric Vehicle Visualization in D3 (Make working Scale for year)

# Day 25 

Continued the Basic JavaScript exercises. I also left my first feedback on other people projects using the FCC Forum. Getting involved with the community remains a priority during this 100 days challenge. I would like to contribute to open source or non profit projects as well, perhaps when I have slightly more experience. Overall Quite productive considering the time spent coding today.

# Day 26

99% of the way through basic Javascript, just stuck on the last 2 recursion problems. I'm resisting the urge to cheat, but I think I need to find some other resources on recursion to get a better grip on the subject. The loops section had me wanting to write python all afternoon.
