# 100 Days of code

## Day 1

WHY: Why code every day for 100 days? So many reasons! First of all I know some web stuff, some python and I even learned Java 4ish years ago. However I don't feel competent in any of this, certainly not experienced enough to freelance, which is the ultimate goal. Additionally I am going to use this challenge to give myself some purpose! I have 3 months without other commitments which is awesome, but I need to impose some discipline to use this time wisely and accomplish anything. Ideally I will end this experience feeling empowered and with real progress and projects to show off. Finally, I decided I need to share more. I am a 'lurker' or someone who just consumes on the web, I want to be a *Maker*! 

So with that out of the way, I have some things to learn :)

*What I did today*
- Basic Html and HTML5 section (1:41) 
*Questions*
- Does the label always have to have a for attribute to link it to its nested elements?
- what is value for again?

## Day 2

Day 1 was pretty easy, The Basic HTML and CSS Section had only 28 modules that I breezed through. Today's CSS section has 48 modules, so I anticipate it will take slightly longer. Yesterday I learned some new things about forms such as how to make checkboxes and radio boxes ticked by default. I also learned how to make fields required. 

*What I did Today*
- Basic CSS (1:18)
- Started applied Visual Design (26:25)


# Day 3 

Still a little fuzzy on the before and after pseudo elements...Applied visual design was 



# Day 6

Finished the lessons for the responsive web design certification. Today I spent time on grid. I am still a little confused, but I will try to use it in the upcoming projects. I'm surprised that I sped through the lessons so fast, perhaps I will pay for this later. I have prior experience, but I am glad I refreshed my memory. Also I definitely learned a lot of new things as a result of going through the lessons. Today I started my first challenge for the responsive web design cert. I am making a tribute page on Percival Baxter. I made a site that passed all the tests in 30 mins, but I really want to work on my design skills, so I think I'll spend half of tomorrow improving the design of the page. Right now the page is...sparse to say the least. 

*What I did Today* 
- Finished Grid Lesson
- Started Tribute page challenge

# Day 7


# Day 9 

Took notes on Design video stream on the FreeCodeCamp YouTube channel. I did this because I am really no happy with how my sites turn out. 

# Day 10 

Finished the Survey page

# Day 11

Started the Landing page challenge

# Day 12

Started a project to scrape data from glassdoor.com. I got the basics down in 6 hours. So far The program scrapes the reviews on the page and prints them in the terminal. The goal is to get all of the data into a pandas dataframe then visualize it with plotly or possibly d3. 

# Day 13

Worked on the parser for the Glassdoor Scraper. I asked by first question on Stack overflow! I don't think anyone has answered yet, but I figured it out, so I may answer it myself tomorrow. 

# Day 14

Finally got the scraper to work (mostly) I decided I am going to do the visualization in PowerBI because this project is taking longer than expected. I can do the d3 later. Things left to do are: Make the date formatting compatible with PowerBI which will involve working with `strptime` in python, and making the sub rankings scraper work. Hopefully I can finish those up tomorrow and get back to FCC. I need to finish the React certification by the end of this!

# Day 15

The Scraper is Good Enough! I tooled around in PowerBI to get a few pretty charts. I think I would need an additional two days to make the data cleaner and PowerBI laid out in a usable manner, however I want to keep up a good pace on the FCC Challenges. I also just found the visual on Free Code Camp that shows your current streak. I pushed anything to the site in over a week! (looking at my time records, I last worked on a Free Code Camp challenge 4 days ago) Maybe I can get a quick and dirty product page working tonight.

# Day 16 

Half day today. I want to get the skeleton of the Product page finished by eod. 
- read up on font pairings
- added a local font 

## Skip Day

# Day 17 

Tweaked styling of the page. 

# Day 18 

- Got the Navbar styled
- photo crop and rotation

# Day 19

This product page needs to be done. As of this Morning it passes all but the navbar tests, but I still want to make links change color in the navbar, improve the Card styling, and adjust the Features section. Also the navbar behaves as described in the User Story, but still doesn't pass the test, I'll have to look into that. I am having some trouble with the link hover transition in the navbar at the moment. 

The navbar was just 10 pixels too low! The test exceptions are written very well. 

- [X] Make navbar test pass
- [ ] Make navbar hover transition work
- [ ] Clean up the Survey

# Day 20

Cleaned up the card on the bottom of the page. I am about halfway through the basic JavaScript exercises. I am quite happy with how the fake product site works. I might tweet it to College Humor and see if they reply. I just have to make the survey and make the navbar work how I want it to.  

# Day 21 

- [X] Make navbar hover transition work
- [ ] Clean up the Survey

# Day 22 

- [ ] Make dropdown work/clean up the survey

To make this work I needed find elements on the page, then add event listeners. For this to work properly the script had to be executed after the page loaded. According to stack overflow, the proper way to do this is: ```window.onload=function```, so that is how I implemented it.

This site is *not* going to be mobile optimized, because I already spent a week on it. I can't even make the media query(which does exist) work properly, or at all. 

# Day 23 

I started playing around with another project in d3, which I probably will never finish. I didn't even make a Github Repo for it. It is a visualization for the availability of electric vehicles. 

# Day 24 

FINISH IT! Almost a quarter of the way through and I'm not even finished with basic web! C'mon! Today I NEED to finish the promo website. Its been passing the tests all week I just need to clean up the survey and add a quick footer--Nothing else! No Mission Creep!

- [x] Clean up Survey Expansion Box
- [x] add a quick n dirty footer
- [x] MAYBE Add more filler text as a result of the Bloomberg Blands article
- [x] Submit Product Landing Page
{done in 1st Hour, its amazing what focus can do!}

- [x] Finish & Submit Documentation Challenge

future:
- [ ] Start Portfolio Challenge
- [ ] Do more JavaScript Exercises
- [ ] Work on Electric Vehicle Visualization in D3 (Make working Scale for year)

# Day 25 

Continued the Basic JavaScript exercises. I also left my first feedback on other people projects using the FCC Forum. Getting involved with the community remains a priority during this 100 days challenge. I would like to contribute to open source or non profit projects as well, perhaps when I have slightly more experience. Overall Quite productive considering the time spent coding today.

# Day 26

99% of the way through basic JavaScript, just stuck on the last 2 recursion problems. I'm resisting the urge to cheat, but I think I need to find some other resources on recursion to get a better grip on the subject. The loops section had me wanting to write python all afternoon. 

*Goals*
- [ ] Finish Basic JavaScript
- [ ] Fix wrap on header in product page 
- [ ] Cost product page on github correctly
- [ ] Post product page and ask for feedback!

# Day 27

I got through the basic Javascript, and am halfway through ES6. I find ES6 to be pretty annoying. To me its a bunch of shortcuts for things I already don't really know how to use. Its cute these shortcuts are called syntactic sugar. I also finally posted my Product page for feedback :<a href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/product-landing-page-looking-for-any-and-all-feedback/426531/2">Product Page</a>.  I figured out how to use Github pages with multiple html pages to do this.

I did a little more research on algorithmic trading this morning. I might start poking around with that tomorrow morning. 

- [x] Finish Basic JavaScript
- [x] Fix wrap on header in product page 
- [x] Host product page on github correctly
- [x] Post product page and ask for feedback!
{All before lunch!}
- [x] Start ES6
- [x] Make list of questions for Sam Wheeler (FullStack Academy Grad) & Contact

# Day 28 

Hit a solid brick wall trying to work within a virtual environment this morning. I somehow figured it out before lunch, not quite sure what I did. Having a virtual environment will be useful for when I containerize this algorithm in a Docker container later. This afternoon I Setup the Finnhub api and yfinance api I acquire ticker data. I also sketched out the basic architecture of the program. The plan is to have a strategy which uses the relative strength index. The strategy will be backtested and the parameters will be grid optimized on each stock in a universe of US common stock with a price in a range and over a specific market capitalization. I'll be using the following python packages: fastquant(built largely on backtester), alpaca, and the common Python data science stuff such as pandas and numpy.

Later....
- [ ] Start Portfolio Website
- [ ] Finish ES6
- [ ] Start Regular Expressions
- [ ] Tweet the site at College Humor?

# Day 29
A most of the morning was spent messing around with a host of APIs to try to get the mkt cap and other information in the most efficient way possible. Finnhub has rate limit which meant that it took over an hour to get the data. It worked but wasn't ideal. It turns out that funded Alpaca accounts have access to the Polygon API Which provides a ton of information with no rate limits. It took a few hours of poking around to find the correct endpoint, but eventually I was able to get all US Common stock between a price and over a certain volume threshhold. This gave me a universe of approximately 1000 equities. 

Next, I set up a grid optimization script which tests various combinations of RSI period, and upper/lower bounds. This is interesting because it creates a 3d array to test these parameters. A real challenge going forward is the speed of this backtest. I need to figure out how far back to backtest to generate the optimized parameters, and how many different parameters to test. Longer term I may look at a more efficient way of optimizing these parameters. right now I am basically brute forcing it. 

# Day 30

First on the agenda today is cleanup. I have a few hundred lines of random strings, hardly in functions. So I need to clean up!

It is modularized, but as it turns out, running over 100,000 tests does not go smoothly, particularly on a single core. Additionally, the more I read the more it seems I am going about this the wrong way. The consensus seems to be that optimization isn't terribly useful for these algorithms. Great. 

# Day 31
Most of this day was spend untangling existing code from fastquant so that I can just use the package its based on called This goes straight to the source, and using a package I will need anyway, I can source all data from the Polygon api, instead of half yahoo, half polygon. Although backtrader is feature rich, its also incredibly object oriented and thoroughly documented. The documentation is great, but frankly I'm just not used to working so deeply with OOB concepts in Python yet. 

# Day 32

Back to free code camp a little. I've decided I want to implement the live trading algorithm without an external library, I think it will be faster if I do it quick and dirty instead of trying to slog through a rudimentary understanding of Backtrader.

- [x] Finish ES6
- [x] Start Regular Expressions 


# Day 33
A lot accomplished today. The backtester now passes the buy and hold as a benchmark which I use to calculate alpha. On a run of 1000 stocks, my optimized rsi generated alpha 93% of the time. 10% of the time it was 100 percentage points better than the return of the stock over the same period. There is no way these results would be replicated in a real test, but this is quite promising. Part of it is the volatility calculated stop loss. 

Going forward I have a plan to implement live trading which will not use backtrader, except for selection of trades.

I also did an exercise in free code camp. Gotta keep the streak alive!

# Skip Day

# Day 34
Continued work on the algorithm. Finished the entry and exit evaluation functions. All thats left to do is hook it up to alpaca and watch it loose money! Also I will need to write some basic allocation logic, but that should be fairly simple.

# Day 35
Re-diagrammed the algorithm I have a better idea of how to build it now. I also worked on integrating the Alpaca API. An hour was spent troubleshooting only to find I didn't have the correct API secret key. 

# Day 36
Theoretically, I have a very unstable live-capable version finished. Not sure, the backtest portion will run overnight. Next steps are more bug fixes, and containerization! I also should run through and clean up the code a bit at some point

# Day 37 
This morning I added a class to organize order types. Going to head back to FCC for at least 50% of the time again. The halfway mark is within sight and I need to finish react by the end of this. 

EOD: I finished the Regex and debugging modules on free code camp. On the trading algo, I got started setting up docker, organized the ordering methods, and added the oco (one cancels other) order type. Also in the trading algo I made the paths more portable. Pathing in Python is easy, but its not something I've done before. The trading algo saves and reads 'pickled' pandas dataframes in multiple places so its important that those places are consistent no matter how the program is run. 

I also re-organized the repo which involved some git shenanigans. 

Tomorrow I'd like to complete basic data structures on free code camp, and implement the oco ordering in the algo. I also will try to make more progress on the dockerization of the algo. Today I ran into an issue with the versioning in one of the 63 requirements.

# Day 38

The container works! I can't be sure, but it's running a full backtest right now without issues. Containerization makes my algorithm much more portable, and by that I mean I don't have to leave my laptop running 24/5 to pick stocks and update orders. Running the script in the container means I can just shove the script in the *cloud*. Right now the container is just running on my laptop, cloud implementation will have to wait for another day. Reflecting on what I said I'd accomplish yesterday, I did mostly the opposite. As of 16:53 I am less than halfway though data structures and still haven't added the One Order Cancels Other to the algo. I'll spend the next hour on basic data structures to see how far I can get. 

This docker thing has me excited! eventually it will be running in the cloud and updating every time I commit to my github repo!


# Day 39

Today I realized I'm writing a program which puts pickles in a blob in a bucket in the cloud using a container. Weird. There are so many strange names for things. A big challenge today was setting up the Google Cloud Storage. This is just a way to dump files in the cloud instead of on the local machine. I need to do this because when the script is running in the cloud, there will be no local filesystem (or at least not one that is persistent). I went in circles when reading the documentation for how to upload or download files for python. I wanted to totally avoid saving anything locally, however I kept running into issues with the codec or mime type of the files I'm working with. I am saving pickle files/objects  which are pythons way of packing objects very small. Eventually I relented and do a temporary local save, then that file is uploaded to the cloud, not as elegant, but I got it to work in a test. Tomorrow I need to implement it in the program. 

I also changed some column types in the backtester to int16 from int64. THis hopefully will help the problem I've had with ram usage. 

# Day 40 

CI/ CD Almost works! I just found out that I can't build from the current github repo because I hid my keys file... so I guess this will force me to handle keys better. I'll need to do research on how to deal with a public girhub repo, docker container build from it and a private key file. Its late, and I am so close, but I need to call it a night. THat is also why this may make less sense than usual. 


# Day 41

Things to figure out:

1. How to pass environment vars on build
    How to pass environment variables on run..?
https://binx.io/blog/2020/07/01/how-to-get-secrets-from-the-google-secret-manager-into-your-container/
2. How to get secrets in the yml.
3. what are yml files.
4. what is a .yaml file
    stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language *eyeroll*. Its a flexible,data oriented language. Its a superset of JSON, and is better because it has extra features like comments, comlex datatypes, is more readable, etc. Used for configuration management, in the context I'm learning it in, this is configuration of a docker image. 
    
    These YAML Files are really darn particular about their formatting. I did a tab instead of three spaces and the cloudbuild had no idea what was going on. 

# Day 42

# Day 43
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xkSvufmjEs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xkSvufmjEs</a>
Spent the morning surfing around looking for bootstrap tips. I made a skeleton site which satisfies all the requirements. I still don't really have a concept for how I want this portfolio site to look. I am tempted to add a d3 network chart, like I always wanted...

# Day 44 
*STILL* bugs in the algo trader. I didn't account for getting positions on a Monday ::eyeroll::. I fixed that (I think). THe rest of the day I worked on getting a force directed chart together for the site. I got my old prototype working in about 3 hours EXCEPT for scaling. I want the chart to dynamically change size for different screen sized, this chart also needs to have the center of the canvas after resizing. this is a real challenge so far. I'll figure it out tomorrow, how hard can it be! 

I am going to run the algo locally today, hopefully it goes off without a hitch. 

# Day 45

GAH. This automated trader is killing me. I am still having issues with it. I added a lot of features to make it more robust, and by that I mean capable of handling edge cases, like...Mondays ::eyeroll::. I also gave it the ability to start without a template positions file, well actually that's the part that still doesn't work. driving me nuts. Furthermore, the editor/ide started getting a little buggy, so I ended the day on a sour note. 

# Day 46

More debugging stuff today, its running now, somewhat confident the program will work today.

# 47 

The program worked! bought 5 stocks. Most of the things it bought were etfs. I'm not sure if I should filter them out. theoretically if the RSI strategy works on them better than anything else, they should work too, but it just gives me pause. I am especially concerned because it seems to have a penchant for highly leveraged etfs.  I added the caching feature today, I am testing it now. This feature minimizes the amount of ram used at a given time. although the way I've written it now, the Maximum ram used does not decrease; just the amount of time that the max ram occurs.

I'm going to put a little more time into the d3 on the porfolio website. I finished the datastructures lessons in FCC today. 

# 48

I worked towards completing the force directed chart on the personal portfolio website today. I added color, sizes, more nodes and links. Tommorrow I plan to add icons to the categories and subcategories. 
Personal Portfolio agenda:
 - [x] Make navbar relevant
 - [x] Nest links in nodes
 - [ ] Choose background colors for each section
 - [ ] add projects to cards
 - [ ] add media query 
 - [ ] make site mobile optimized
 - 
 
# 49 

Added icons, restructured the json file to add the links inside the node objects. Started to adjust colors . I also fixed a new bug I made in the trading algo. Longer term, the next algo feature should be correlation analysis.

# 50 

I can finish the portfolio project today, day 50!

Update. Portfolio is complete. I'm going to run the algo on the vm tonight.

# 51

I had to fix another issue with the algo and stored portfolio values. It turns out dataframe.update doesn't behave the way I expected it to. I replaced that operation with combine first which seems to do the trick, however this means that I have to reset the portfolio and therefore the api keys again. 

# skip day :)

# 56

Basic algorithm scripting work. like banging my head against a wall

# 57

Worked on he basic algorithm scripting challenges. Not for very long. I hate this module. 

# 58

1 day project! I created the JustGoes page to display GOES images from the GOES NOAA satellite on a minimal webpage. These are images of earth updated every 10 minutes and on a 1/2 hour delay, which is as good as live for me. I bought a square 19' monitor for 10$ on facebook marketplace, pulled up the page on a raspberry pi, and viola! I have a live satellite photo of earth to decorate my office. Now I just need to make a frame for the monitor. <a href="https://github.com/EthanMerrill/JustGOES">JustGOES repository.  

# 59

Worked through some object oriented programming problems. I also made the raspberry pi load the JustGOES page fullscreen on boot. 

# 60 

a few minutes on the algo today

# 61

Setup chron function to launch the algorithm every weekday at 8pm. I got it to work, but I am still frustrated by how convoluted the process was. In gcloud I had to use 3 different apis to make the thing work: Chron (some sort of unix command thing) triggers => function (a serverless cloud script, like AWS lambda) launches => A Virtual Machine (Google cloud compute). Seems like one should be able to schedule a cloud function without a whole other api. However this must all be in the name of modularity. I have played with the idea of running the whole script from gcloud functions, but didn't get very far (it would be cheaper).    

# 62

Working through most of functional programming. Glad to be moving right along again

# 63 11/29/2020

Finished Functional Programming. This module was a breeze. I use functional programming in all my python code. Seems like its a sanctioned structure, so I don't feel as guilty not adhering to OOB concepts. 

goal for tomorrow: finish Javascript section!

# 64

I spent some time today re-writing the backtester to use the backtrader parameter optimization, as it turns out this method of optimizing parameters can only use one core, and as a result is 5x slower than the method I was already using (~30 hours per backtest!). So I guess I'll roll it back tomorrow. I also did a challenge on FCC.

# 65 

Spent the day rolling back the work I did yesterday. I found some of it could be kept. I found I could replace the grid optimization with a lambda function, so that probly shaved a few seconds off processing time

# 66 

I added a shutdown trigger in gcloud, so finally, the algo is running entirely unattended. It also looks like it will cost about 15$ a month to run on the vm, so ehhh. I'll forget about it for a bit and see how it does.

# 67

All these Javascript challenges are really wearing me down. I am trying my best to refocus today, I keep reminding myself that react and shiny frameworks are just around the corner! I found a tutorial for launching an react app on AWS, I think this will be useful: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/#:~:text=Deploy%20and%20Host%20a%20React,)%3A%20Create%20a%20GraphQL%20API.">React App Tutorial</a>

# 68
More Algorithms today! AHHHH. I finally found some videos I like, so I started following along with someone ele doing the challenges I got stuck on. This has been a good way to lift my head, and prevent it from banging on my desktop incessantly while I try to work my way through these challenges. 

# 69

I used more of those videos today from the Usedful programmer on youtube. I also stalked the guy who makes them, Seems like he is a digital nomad with slightly right leaning political views, and a fan of Ray Dalio. Interesting! Only 2 challenges left in the Javascript section!

# 70 

Finished Javascript challenges. It was awful. I do know JS slightly better though, I might reatain and understand about 20% of what was presented. Still a victory.

# 71

Started the bootstrap section. I am flying through this section so far. Didn't spend too much time today. Working in my room and the power is out

# 72

I Made It! I arrived at the React Section. I kind of want to save it till tomorrow actually. After spending so much time in Javascript, this front end libraries certification is flying by so far. Attended a react conference as an intro to react this afternoon. 

# 73

Working my way through the react module. So far things are fairly easy. I also listened to a presentation from the founder of next.js at the react conference. His talk was thoroughly over my head. 

# 74 

Kept trucking on React. State is very confusing. It seems like a lot of steps to bind a function and modify state. 

# 75 

Today I plan to: 
- [x] finish React Module
- [ ] debug trading algo

Finished today off with some intro videos on Redux. Its a state management system which is *really* confusing.

# 76

- [ ] finish the Redux module
- [x] debug trading algo

# 77
 I switched over to degugging the trading also again. It was overwritting the record of the portfolio with nan values. It is a real pain to fix and debug at this point. I also spent a lot of time trying to get the vm to automativally use the latest docker image in my repository. This is the last part of my CI/CD toolchain, and I just couldn't make it work. In the vm options (google compute) I set the directory of the built docker image like so: `gcr.io/backtestalgov1/github.com/ethanmerrill/tradingalgoexperimentation@sha256:xyzxyzxyzxyz` in the container image field of the compute engine instance. I should be able to use the latest image in the `gcr.io/backtestalgov1/github.com/ethanmerrill/tradingalgoexperimentation` directory by appending a `:latest` tag. the script for building the docker images automatically appends the latest tag to the most recently built image. However when I use : `tradingalgoexperimentation:latest` it doesn't work...
- [ ] finish the redux module

# 78
I need to finish the Redux module today. Redux makes little sense and its discouraging. 
- [x] finish the Redux module
    These final sections of the Redux module teach state immutability
- [ ] finish React and Redux module (the last of the front end libraries certification!!)

# 79

- [x] finish React and Redux module (the last of the front end libraries certification!!)

# SOmeday dec 17
The algo is stuck on an old distribution. I have no idea how to fix it. So I changed gears and worked on react stuff today. This morning I watched some videos about webpack, concluded it was too big for what I'm working with, and started a project using nano react. This react starter kit uses parcel instead of webpack. I found that using hooks and functional components is far easier than classes and set state stuff. I hope that this doesn't come back to bite me later. Thinking it through, I might be able to avoid redux by learning react with functional components, then learning next.js or possibly Gatsby. That's my preliminary plan at least. 

# Dec 18

Passed the tests on random quote machine and markdown previewer. They're both kinda ugly still, but I'll fix that later. I asked a<a href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/usestate-callback-random-quote-machine/436149/4"> question </a> relating to useEffect on the Free Code Camp forum and got a good answer almost immediately. Working with functional components in react is a breeze! Its nice to be moving again. I finished off the day by researching Content Management Systems for my personal website. I would like a system which has the following features: *Self hosted* because I don't what all my posts to be hosted on another companies servers. That company who is providing free content hosting, not out of the goodness of their heart, but because of the prospect that I might pay to have my content hosted by them in the future. *GraphQL* Admittedly, I don't know a whole lot about API protocols, but it seems like the world is moving from RESTful interfaces to graphQL as a way to retrieve content from databases/servers. *Minimal* as The Notorious BIG said: mo' features mo' problems. More features means more to maintain, and given I don't plan to pay for this service... I'm not expecting a whole lot in terms of support or even continued development, so I need something simple.*widely used* I'm going to have a ton of challenges setting this up, so I need hundreds of stack overflow answers, video tutorials, and forum posts to each problem I encounter *Open Source* Everyone knows open source is the only way...

From what I can tell Strapi is the best option, it is a little too complex, and has a paid tier they would undoubtedly love for me to convert to, but it can be self hosted, is open source and uses graphql. Plus the community is quite large. 

# Dec 19 

Drum Machine Finished. 

# Dec 20 

I hit a wall on the calculator. I ended the day without having any idea on how to update the display and operations. However I do have half the tests passing and a working Key generator function, so it looks something like a calculator at least.

# Dec 21

Ran into an issue with passing React-hooks, and the FCC tests. Somehow I fixed it, still not sure how. Someone on the FCC Discord helped me. Added React-router. This tool is far easier than I remember it being. 

# Dec 22



# Dec 23

Lots of intense focus today. I can feel the end approaching, so I know I need to pick up the pace. I spent most of the morning grinding out regular expressions on the calculator challenge. I know that the way I wrote it isn't ideal, but I finally found the right combination of regular expressions to make it work. The biggest challenge was the leading negative signs. EX: 3*-4. 

Finally, I got all the tests to pass and I started on the Pomodoro clock. I have about 7 tests passing at the moment. These tests are just setting up the buttons. I feel myself getting more confident with React during each challenge. I am almost ready to move onto my own project! 

I'll need to make these projects look halfway alright with CSS (they are barebones now) and I'll need to figure out how to put these challenges in a subdirectory on this Github site. I am budgeting about a day and a half for these tasks. Design is simultaneously easy and very difficult: Changes are easy, but making a site look good is very hard for me still.
