# 100 Days of code

## Day 1

WHY: Why code every day for 100 days? So many reasons! First of all I know some web stuff, some python and I even learned Java 4ish years ago. However I don't feel competent in any of this, certainly not experienced enough to freelance, which is the ultimate goal. Additionally I am going to use this challenge to give myself some purpose! I have 3 months without other commitments which is awesome, but I need to impose some discipline to use this time wisely and accomplish anything. Ideally I will end this experience feeling empowered and with real progress and projects to show off. Finally, I decided I need to share more. I am a 'lurker' or someone who just consumes on the web, I want to be a *Maker*! 

So with that out of the way, I have some things to learn :)

*What I did today*
- Basic Html and HTML5 section (1:41) 
*Questions*
- Does the label always have to have a for attribute to link it to its nested elements?
- what is value for again?

## Day 2

Day 1 was pretty easy, The Basic HTML and CSS Section had only 28 modules that I breezed through. Today's CSS section has 48 modules, so I anticipate it will take slightly longer. Yesterday I learned some new things about forms such as how to make checkboxes and radio boxes ticked by default. I also learned how to make fields required. 

*What I did Today*
- Basic CSS (1:18)
- Started applied Visual Design (26:25)


# Day 3 

Still a little fuzzy on the before and after pseudo elements...Applied visual design was 



# Day 6

Finished the lessons for the responsive web design certification. Today I spent time on grid. I am still a little confused, but I will try to use it in the upcoming projects. I'm surprised that I sped through the lessons so fast, perhaps I will pay for this later. I have prior experience, but I am glad I refreshed my memory. Also I definitely learned a lot of new things as a result of going through the lessons. Today I started my first challenge for the responsive web design cert. I am making a tribute page on Percival Baxter. I made a site that passed all the tests in 30 mins, but I really want to work on my design skills, so I think I'll spend half of tomorrow improving the design of the page. Right now the page is...sparse to say the least. 

*What I did Today* 
- Finished Grid Lesson
- Started Tribute page challenge

# Day 7


# Day 9 

Took notes on Design video stream on the FreeCodeCamp YouTube channel. I did this because I am really no happy with how my sites turn out. 

# Day 10 

Finished the Survey page

# Day 11

Started the Landing page challenge

# Day 12

Started a project to scrape data from glassdoor.com. I got the basics down in 6 hours. So far The program scrapes the reviews on the page and prints them in the terminal. The goal is to get all of the data into a pandas dataframe then visualize it with plotly or possibly d3. 

# Day 13

Worked on the parser for the Glassdoor Scraper. I asked by first question on Stack overflow! I don't think anyone has answered yet, but I figured it out, so I may answer it myself tomorrow. 

# Day 14

Finally got the scraper to work (mostly) I decided I am going to do the visualization in PowerBI because this project is taking longer than expected. I can do the d3 later. Things left to do are: Make the date formatting compatible with PowerBI which will involve working with `strptime` in python, and making the sub rankings scraper work. Hopefully I can finish those up tomorrow and get back to FCC. I need to finish the React certification by the end of this!

# Day 15

The Scraper is Good Enough! I tooled around in PowerBI to get a few pretty charts. I think I would need an additional two days to make the data cleaner and PowerBI laid out in a usable manner, however I want to keep up a good pace on the FCC Challenges. I also just found the visual on Free Code Camp that shows your current streak. I pushed anything to the site in over a week! (looking at my time records, I last worked on a Free Code Camp challenge 4 days ago) Maybe I can get a quick and dirty product page working tonight.

# Day 16 

Half day today. I want to get the skeleton of the Product page finished by eod. 
- read up on font pairings
- added a local font 

## Skip Day

# Day 17 

Tweaked styling of the page. 

# Day 18 

- Got the Navbar styled
- photo crop and rotation

# Day 19

This product page needs to be done. As of this Morning it passes all but the navbar tests, but I still want to make links change color in the navbar, improve the Card styling, and adjust the Features section. Also the navbar behaves as described in the User Story, but still doesn't pass the test, I'll have to look into that. I am having some trouble with the link hover transition in the navbar at the moment. 

The navbar was just 10 pixels too low! The test exceptions are written very well. 

- [X] Make navbar test pass
- [ ] Make navbar hover transition work
- [ ] Clean up the Survey

# Day 20

Cleaned up the card on the bottom of the page. I am about halfway through the basic JavaScript exercises. I am quite happy with how the fake product site works. I might tweet it to College Humor and see if they reply. I just have to make the survey and make the navbar work how I want it to.  

# Day 21 

- [X] Make navbar hover transition work
- [ ] Clean up the Survey

# Day 22 

- [ ] Make dropdown work/clean up the survey

To make this work I needed find elements on the page, then add event listeners. For this to work properly the script had to be executed after the page loaded. According to stack overflow, the proper way to do this is: ```window.onload=function```, so that is how I implemented it.

This site is *not* going to be mobile optimized, because I already spent a week on it. I can't even make the media query(which does exist) work properly, or at all. 

# Day 23 

I started playing around with another project in d3, which I probably will never finish. I didn't even make a Github Repo for it. It is a visualization for the availability of electric vehicles. 

# Day 24 

FINISH IT! Almost a quarter of the way through and I'm not even finished with basic web! C'mon! Today I NEED to finish the promo website. Its been passing the tests all week I just need to clean up the survey and add a quick footer--Nothing else! No Mission Creep!

- [x] Clean up Survey Expansion Box
- [x] add a quick n dirty footer
- [x] MAYBE Add more filler text as a result of the Bloomberg Blands article
- [x] Submit Product Landing Page
{done in 1st Hour, its amazing what focus can do!}

- [x] Finish & Submit Documentation Challenge

future:
- [ ] Start Portfolio Challenge
- [ ] Do more JavaScript Exercises
- [ ] Work on Electric Vehicle Visualization in D3 (Make working Scale for year)

# Day 25 

Continued the Basic JavaScript exercises. I also left my first feedback on other people projects using the FCC Forum. Getting involved with the community remains a priority during this 100 days challenge. I would like to contribute to open source or non profit projects as well, perhaps when I have slightly more experience. Overall Quite productive considering the time spent coding today.

# Day 26

99% of the way through basic JavaScript, just stuck on the last 2 recursion problems. I'm resisting the urge to cheat, but I think I need to find some other resources on recursion to get a better grip on the subject. The loops section had me wanting to write python all afternoon. 

*Goals*
- [ ] Finish Basic JavaScript
- [ ] Fix wrap on header in product page 
- [ ] Cost product page on github correctly
- [ ] Post product page and ask for feedback!

# Day 27

I got through the basic Javascript, and am halfway through ES6. I find ES6 to be pretty annoying. To me its a bunch of shortcuts for things I already don't really know how to use. Its cute these shortcuts are called syntactic sugar. I also finally posted my Product page for feedback :<a href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/product-landing-page-looking-for-any-and-all-feedback/426531/2">Product Page</a>.  I figured out how to use Github pages with multiple html pages to do this.

I did a little more research on algorithmic trading this morning. I might start poking around with that tomorrow morning. 

- [x] Finish Basic JavaScript
- [x] Fix wrap on header in product page 
- [x] Host product page on github correctly
- [x] Post product page and ask for feedback!
{All before lunch!}
- [x] Start ES6
- [x] Make list of questions for Sam Wheeler (FullStack Academy Grad) & Contact

# Day 28 

Hit a solid brick wall trying to work within a virtual environment this morning. I somehow figured it out before lunch, not quite sure what I did. Having a virtual environment will be useful for when I containerize this algorithm in a Docker container later. This afternoon I Setup the Finnhub api and yfinance api I acquire ticker data. I also sketched out the basic architecture of the program. The plan is to have a strategy which uses the relative strength index. The strategy will be backtested and the parameters will be grid optimized on each stock in a universe of US common stock with a price in a range and over a specific market capitalization. I'll be using the following python packages: fastquant(built largely on backtester), alpaca, and the common Python data science stuff such as pandas and numpy.

Later....
- [ ] Start Portfolio Website
- [ ] Finish ES6
- [ ] Start Regular Expressions
- [ ] Tweet the site at College Humor?

# Day 29
A most of the morning was spent messing around with a host of APIs to try to get the mkt cap and other information in the most efficient way possible. Finnhub has rate limit which meant that it took over an hour to get the data. It worked but wasn't ideal. It turns out that funded Alpaca accounts have access to the Polygon API Which provides a ton of information with no rate limits. It took a few hours of poking around to find the correct endpoint, but eventually I was able to get all US Common stock between a price and over a certain volume threshhold. This gave me a universe of approximately 1000 equities. 

Next, I set up a grid optimization script which tests various combinations of RSI period, and upper/lower bounds. This is interesting because it creates a 3d array to test these parameters. A real challenge going forward is the speed of this backtest. I need to figure out how far back to backtest to generate the optimized parameters, and how many different parameters to test. Longer term I may look at a more efficient way of optimizing these parameters. right now I am basically brute forcing it. 

# Day 30

First on the agenda today is cleanup. I have a few hundred lines of random strings, hardly in functions. So I need to clean up!

It is modularized, but as it turns out, running over 100,000 tests does not go smoothly, particularly on a single core. Additionally, the more I read the more it seems I am going about this the wrong way. The consensus seems to be that optimization isn't terribly useful for these algorithms. Great. 

# Day 31
Most of this day was spend untangling existing code from fastquant so that I can just use the package its based on called This goes straight to the source, and using a package I will need anyway, I can source all data from the Polygon api, instead of half yahoo, half polygon. Although backtrader is feature rich, its also incredibly object oriented and thoroughly documented. The documentation is great, but frankly I'm just not used to working so deeply with OOB concepts in Python yet. 

# Day 32

Back to free code camp a little. I've decided I want to implement the live trading algorithm without an external library, I think it will be faster if I do it quick and dirty instead of trying to slog through a rudimentary understanding of Backtrader.

- [x] Finish ES6
- [x] Start Regular Expressions 


# Day 33
A lot accomplished today. The backtester now passes the buy and hold as a benchmark which I use to calculate alpha. On a run of 1000 stocks, my optimized rsi generated alpha 93% of the time. 10% of the time it was 100 percentage points better than the return of the stock over the same period. There is no way these results would be replicated in a real test, but this is quite promising. Part of it is the volatility calculated stop loss. 

Going forward I have a plan to implement live trading which will not use backtrader, except for selection of trades.

I also did an exercise in free code camp. Gotta keep the streak alive!

# Skip Day

# Day 34
Continued work on the algorithm. Finished the entry and exit evaluation functions. All thats left to do is hook it up to alpaca and watch it loose money! Also I will need to write some basic allocation logic, but that should be fairly simple
